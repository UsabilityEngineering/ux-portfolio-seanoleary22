I have found my experience with the radio system for my 2013 Subaru impreza to be fairly consistent with most stock and basic(non touchscreen) radio systems in cars to date. It possesses all the necessary features for base radio operation and good labeling for the buttons so as not to confuse the user. But I wanted to mention one of the worst expereinces I have had in recent history with a product expereince and as its something I use often it continues to glare at me. 

The bluetooth set up for this car is so terrible. Not only does it take a while to set up every time I want to change a bluetooth device as it only has the memory for one, but it makes me go through a process that took me a month to learn and replicate every time I want to connect to my car for audio.

The process is detailed below:
Starting out the car takes about 15-20 seconds after starting up for the system to be ready to accept a bluetooth connection
For device setup or new device connection:
1. I have to click the "cd/aux" button until the screen says bluetooth
2. I then have to hit the "menu" button to bring up settings
3. I then have to use the right knob to select bluetooth setup and use the push in button on the right knob to select it, I then have to go through bluetooth setup on my phone which doesn't always work
4. it then should be connected 
For recurring connection:
1. I first have to make sure I am set for bluetooth audio, and if not I have to navigate there
2. Then I have to hit the menu button to bring up settings, I then use the right knob to scroll to the "bluetooth connect" option
3. use the push in button on the knob to select that
4. then I have to use the knob again to select my phone from the list of devices (which doesn't make sense as it only accepts one device)
5. I then pray it connects properly, and if it doesn't I have to start this process over again

Overall its just so inefficient that it frustrates me almost every time I get in my car and I feel its aperfect example of a half baked user experience within a half decint product.
